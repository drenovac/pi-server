## Resources

Kody previously recommended the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as part of an ethical hacking kit, but the Raspberry Pi 5 is a worthy successor and a solid upgrade. While its Wi-Fi card doesnâ€™t support Wi-Fi hacking out of the box like on the Pi 3 B+, it comes equipped with a faster processor, huge RAM boost, real-time clock (RTC), PCIe 2.0 support, power button, and much more.
